Cosby
=====
A spin off of [Webrickroll](https://github.com/angeleah/webrickroll), a Rails Engine packaged as a gem that will highjack every request and redirect to the Cosby Rap video. This gem is server independent. Enjoy.

GETTING STARTED
---------------
- To use:
  + Add the gem to the Gemfile( gem "cosby") and bundle.
  + Stop and restart the server
  + Navigate to any route within your app.
- To use discreetly(say, while your pair is in the restroom in order to surprise them upon return):
  + Add the gem to the Gemfile( gem "cosby") and bundle.
  + Do this in a separate tab and then close it to leave no suspicion.
  + Stop and restart the server
  + Allow your unsuspecting victim to navigate to any route within your app.
  + Enjoy the video and feel the sweet victory of pulling off a hilarious prank.
  + Simply remove the gem from the Gemfile and re-bundle to remove the redirection to the video.
  + Lock your computer the next time you go to the bathroom.
